# [19 by Veli](http://veli.ee/19/)
19 is a brand, which I hoped would gain a little momentum, as printable tokens of gratitude, the proceeds of which would go to our health care professionals. 
Alas, I am not too great of a project manager, so the project stayed hidden. So I decided to open source it (my second attempt, first being [Northeast by Veli](https://github.com/veli/northeast) )

## Symbol essence
*    A negative test result
*    the number 19, which hardly anyone will forget
*    the cross of emergency medical services
*    symbol on ambulance
*    the flower of life
*    a heart 
*    and a face mask

## Brandmark construction
### Symbol
The shape's main idea is to bring a little colorful into an overwhelmed and miserable situation, with pins/badges/reflectors with the logo to show your support. 

## Can you find a good use for it? 
The brand is designed with flexibility to be used on all sorts of materials, even t-shirts, tote bags, even face masks themselves
Are you a great marketer and would like to make this brand happen? [Let me know!](mailto:yo@veli.ee)

### Licence
Currently licenced under CC, would love a non-profit to adopt it and make it big,
