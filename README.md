# [19 by Veli](http://veli.ee/19/)
19 is a brand, which I hoped would gain a little momentum, as printable tokens of gratitude, the proceeds of which would have gpme to our health care professionals. 
Alas, I had a little too much on my plate, so the project stayed mostly hidden, seen only in 1 facebook thread. So I decided to open source it (my second attempt, first being [Northeast by Veli](https://github.com/veli/northeast) )

## Symbol essence
*   🧪 A negative test result 
*   🦠 the number 19, which hardly anyone will forget
*   🏥 the cross of emergency medical services
*   🚑 symbol on ambulance
*   💮 the flower of life
*   💙 a heart 
*   😷 and a face mask

## Brandmark construction
### Symbol
The shape's main idea is to bring a little colorful into an overwhelmed and miserable situation, with pins/badges/reflectors with the logo to show your support. 

## Can you find a good use for it? 
The brand is designed with flexibility to be used on all sorts of materials, even t-shirts, tote bags, even face masks themselves
Are you a great marketer and would like to make this brand happen? [Let me know!](mailto:yo@veli.ee)

### Licence
Currently licenced under CC, would love a non-profit to adopt it and make it big,
