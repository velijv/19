# [19 by Veli](http://veli.ee/19/)
19 is a brand, which gained a little momentum, but didn't finish as printable tokens of gratitude, the proceeds of which would have gone to our healthcare professionals. 
Alas, I had a little too much on my plate ⚡and the project stayed in the drawing board. So I decided to give it away (my second one actually, first being [an Estonian National Brand Competition finalist](https://github.com/velijv/northeast) )

  <summary>Symbol essence</summary>
  
## Symbol essence
*   🧪 A negative test result 
*   🦠 the number 19, which hardly anyone will forget
*   🏥 the cross of emergency medical services
*   🚑 symbol on ambulance
*   💮 the flower of life
*   💙 a heart 
*   😷 and a face mask

  <summary>Main idea</summary>
  
## Symbol
The shape's main idea is to bring a little color and cheer into an overwhelming and miserable situation, creating pins/badges/reflectors with the logo to show your support of our healthcare. And give the profits to those working hard to cure us,

## Can you find a good use for it? 
The brand is designed with flexibility to be used on all sorts of materials, t-shirts, tote bags, even face masks. 
Are you a great marketer and would like to make this brand happen?
